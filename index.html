    <div id="aboutScratch">
        <p>
            Scratch is a beginner-friendly, visual programming language that lets users create interactive stories, games, and animations using drag-and-drop coding blocks. Designed by MIT, it makes learning to code fun and accessible. Scratch empowers creativity while letting us try key programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and arrays.

        <p class="title">Why Scratch lessons?.</p>
        <p>
            Learning to code can be very daunting, the syntax is specific, the logic can be very confusing and the worst part is you may not even know where to start. Look no more, I am here to help! I think coding is a skill not an inherant abilty. When learning any skill you should approach it from a point that is engaging, fun and simple. I am offering lessons to introduce anyone, regardless of age to coding and design. We won't be reading documents nor textbooks instead we will make it fun by engaging you to make games! If this sounds scary to you, please don't be discouraged, I have divided the entire process into 4 easy segments, where we will look at each one and explore them together. Instead of starting at logic and reasoning we will first build our games with simple inputs like pressing an arrow key. This way we get a feel for Scratch without being forced into logic. I will be there to helpwith any problems as we explore together.

        <p class="title">Interview.</p>
        <p>Here you will get to meet with me and we can explore what you want to learn or want help with. </p>
        <p class="title">Standard first Lesson</p>
        <p>We will start here with inputs.</p>
        <p>Then we will look at connecting those inputs to simple objects like squares and circles!</p>
        <p>After we will introduce costumes.</p>
        <p>Next we will introduce a small bit of logic with "if" blocks.</p>
        <p>Then we will look at assembeling conditions.</p>
        <p>Finally I will give you some condition challenges.</p>
        <p class="title">Standard second Lesson</p>
        <p>First we will look at the challenges you completed, taking the time to answer any questions you have.</p>
        <p>Next we will introduce variables.</p>
        <p>After this we will show how to change variables.</p>
        <p>Then we will expand on conditions with making a sprite write a sentance for us.</p>
        <p>Next I will challenge you to make something using variables.</p>
        <p>After we will do an experiment looking at the different types of variables.</p>
        <p>Finally we will connect this to inputs and make our first compleate game together we will make our own car game taking it further with objectives.</p>
        <p class="title">Third Standard Lesson</p>
        <p>Here we will introduce clones and take a look at how they work.</p>
        <p>We will explore ways to control the clones.</p>
        <p>Next we will make a game using clones.</p>
        <p>And we will look at how to arrange these clones.</p>
        <p> Finally we will build tic tac toe in Scratch.</p>
        <p class="title"> Forth Standard Lesson</p>
        <p>I will ask you to build a game, you can pick from a list of ideas if you need inspiration.</p>
        <p>I will help you with any problems you have and we can review topics if you want.</p>
        <p class="title">Pricing</p>
        <p>Finally for pricing I will offer the Interview meeting free so you can see if you like it with classes after that being $15 an hour. Let's build games together!</p>
